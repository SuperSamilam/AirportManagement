Welcome To Airplane management
This game is inspired heavily by Fly corp by Kishmish games
But all code is made by myself

How to play
Every x seconds a new airport will unlock
You can click on airports to upgrade their capacity
If they get to full you will lose :(
They will have a red color if they get to full
After you unlocked x airports the airports will now be splited, one side is (left)green and the other (right)dark green
The right side shows how much cargo space you have left, the left side shows how much passanger space you have left

There are also 2 different types of planes. Make sure you always have all the planes
You can upgrade planes and they will then have more capacity and go faster

You can also click on a route to buy more planes for that route.
When you unlock cargo rember to buy cargoplanes because you do not get thoose

To build a new route right click and hold on an airport then drag and realse on the second airport and you will create a new route if you get enough money

BE WARE THIS GAME IS NOT BALANCED
